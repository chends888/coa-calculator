# Curse of Aros (mobile MMORPG) Skills calculator
https://chends888.github.io/coa-calculator/

This is a calculator built with React to support calculating Skills XP on CoA.


## Setup (install `npm` dependencies):

`npm install`

If npm is not installed, run `sudo apt install npm`

## Run on develop server:
`npm run start`

## Dependencies
(no need to run these on setup, they will be automatically installed upon running `npm install`)

`npm install @mui/material --save`

`npm install @mui/icons-material --save`

## Deploy on GitHub Pages:

This is not necessary because the project has a workflow that automates the deployment process and auto updates the gh-pages branch. (check `.github/workflows/node.js.yml`)

`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`

`npm run deploy`
